  ## About SESsION

SESsION is the ontology derived from the concetual integration of multiple social-ecological system paradigms beginning with the ecosystem services (ESs) cascade [4] and the social-ecological system framework (SESF) [4].

Although the integration of ESs cascade and SESF is not complete, this ontology represents a first implementation following two prior publications at the Research Challenges in Information Science explaining the frameworks integrations and related ontological analysis [1,2]. The ontological analysis were performed following mainly the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO) [5], the Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering (DOLCE) [6], and related literature as references. For more detail please consult [1,2].

SESsION is aligned with gUFO (the lightweight version of UFO: https://purl.org/nemo/gufo) and references DOLCE+DnS Ultralite (a simplified version of DOLCE: http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl). Several additional foundational concepts were added based on UFO [5], particularly UFO-C, and DOLCE cognate literature.

The ESs cascade elements included are:
- **Ecosystem Service**;
- **Ecosystem Structure**;
- **Ecosystem Function** (in SESsION redesigned as Functional Role);
- **Commitment-Based Servic**e (newly introduced entity to complement natural Ecosystem Service);
- **Value** (in SESsION redesigned using the Relator **Value Acription** following UFO);
- **Benefit**.

The SESF elements included are:
- **Resource**;
- **Actor**;
- **Resource System**;
- **Governance**;
- **ActionSituation**.

## Why SESsION?

This ontology has been created to facilitate interoperability and compatibility of social-ecological systems studies, and to support data collection and interpretation for participatory sense-making workshops with stakeholders.
