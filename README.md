  ## About SESsION

SESsION is the ontology derived from the concetual integration of ecosystem services (ESs) cascade and social-ecological system framework (SESF).

Although the complete integration of ESs cascade and SESF is not complete, this ontology represents a first implementation following two prior publications explaining the two frameworks integrations and related ontological analysis. The ontological analysis were performed following mainly DOLCE, UFO and related literature. 

SESsION has been directly aligned with gUFO (the lightweight version of UFO: http://purl.org/nemo/gufo) and references DOLCE+DnS Ultralite (http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl).

The ESs cascade elements included are:
- **Ecosystem Service**;
- **Ecosystem Structure**;
- **Ecosystem Function** (in SESsION redesigned as Functional Role);
- **Commitment-Based Servic**e (newly introduced entity to complement natural Ecosystem Service);
- **Value** (in SESsION redesigned using the Relator **Value Acription** following UFO);
- **Benefit**.

The SESF elements included are:
- **Resource**;
- **Actor**;
- **Resource System**;
- **Governance**;
- **ActionSituation**.

## Why SESsION?

This ontology has been created to facilitate interoperability and compatibility of social-ecological systems studies, and to support data collection and interpretation for participatory sense-making workshops with stakeholders.
